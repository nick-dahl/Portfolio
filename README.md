This project explores the potential for restorative forest management practices and the deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in Western United States – California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington – through the use of an R-Shiny web application interface and visualization tool. The goal of this project is to allow for the iteration and exploration of key biomass and geologic resources in the region that could support BECCS systems, and to make initial estimates of the total potential volume of woody biomass in the region, as measured by bone dry tons (BDT) and tons of CO2e, based on a query-based analysis of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. These data are then used in estimates of the potential net emissions benefits from the removal and utilization of this biomass from a life cycle perspective, comparing BECCS to different utilization or removal opportunities, to scope the economic feasibility and generate climactic, environmental, and economic benefits. By using an R-Shiny platform, the web application (https://nickdahl.shinyapps.io/WoodyBiomassApp/) generates a friendly user interface for the customization and iteration of various scenarios, each of which returns a host of plots and tables describing, in turn, the available resources that meet the criteria.
